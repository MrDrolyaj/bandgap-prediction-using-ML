**Bandgap Prediction of Carbon Allotropes using ML Techniques**

Note: Most of the code patterns, esp. the descriptors are based to the study "Naturally-meaningful and efficient descriptors: machine learning of material properties based on robust one-shot ab initio descriptors" (https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.03392). 
Improvements of the descriptors are still on-going.
